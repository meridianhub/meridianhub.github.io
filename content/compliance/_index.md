## Enterprise-Proven Foundations

Meridian is built on the same architectural patterns trusted by major global banks. We follow the Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN) standards, ensuring our platform speaks the language of financial services and integrates seamlessly with existing banking infrastructure.

This isn't experimental software. It's production-grade infrastructure designed with the rigour expected of systems that handle real money.

## Complete Audit History

Every transaction in Meridian is immutably recorded from the moment it enters the system. Nothing is overwritten. Nothing is deleted. Your auditors can trace any position, any valuation, any settlement back to its source.

When regulators ask questions, you have answers. When disputes arise, you have evidence. Built-in compliance means fewer surprises and faster audits.

## Secure Multi-Organisation Support

Meridian supports multiple organisations from day one, with complete data isolation between tenants. Whether you're a bank serving multiple subsidiaries, an NGO managing separate programmes, or a service provider hosting multiple clients, the platform keeps everything separate and secure.

No retrofitting. No workarounds. Multi-tenant security is foundational, not an afterthought.

## Bank-Grade, Open Source

We believe trust infrastructure should be transparent. That's why Meridian is open source. You can inspect every line of code, verify our security practices, and contribute improvements.

Enterprise-proven. Regulatory-ready. Audit-compliant. Open.
