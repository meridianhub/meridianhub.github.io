## Trust Infrastructure Shouldn't Be a Privilege

The same tools that power financial institutions should be available to everyone. Meridian brings banking-grade treasury infrastructure to organisations of all sizes, regardless of their resources or location.

---

## Enterprise

**For organisations that need certainty.**

Multi-tenant cloud hosting available with Service Level Agreements. Get compliance support and certification assistance, dedicated support channels, and professional services for implementation.

Your operations deserve infrastructure that matches your standards.

---

## Self-Hosted

**For organisations that value control.**

Run Meridian on your own infrastructure with full control over data and deployment. Access the same codebase as enterprise users, with community support via GitHub and Discord.

No vendor lock-in. Your data stays yours.

---

## NGOs and Developing Economies

**For organisations building a better world.**

The same banking-grade infrastructure, free forever under open source licence. Community-driven support helps you get started.

We believe democratising access to financial technology enables inclusion globally. Trust infrastructure shouldn't depend on geography or budget.

---

## One Codebase, Three Paths

Whether you choose managed hosting, self-hosted deployment, or community support, you get the same robust foundation. The only difference is how you want to run it.

**Open source. Open access. Open future.**
