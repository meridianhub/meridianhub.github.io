          Phantom shortfalls destroy lives. A duplicate transaction, a race condition,
          a network retry counted twice &mdash; and someone faces an accusation they cannot disprove.
        </p>
        <p class="proof">
          Every position recorded with atomic audit trails. Parent-child transaction lineage preserved.
          Idempotent operations mean the same request twice produces the same result once.
          The accused can demand proof &mdash; and get it.

          Value doesn't always look like currency anymore. Energy credits, carbon offsets,
          compute resources, agricultural commodities &mdash; the economy runs on assets that traditional ledgers can't handle.

          Multi-asset architecture handles kilowatt-hours, tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>, and commodity units
          with the same rigour as pounds and euros. Proper dimensional typing prevents
          nonsense calculations. One system, any asset class.

          When settlement fails, it cascades. Livelihoods depend on money arriving when promised,

          Lien-based fund reservation guarantees availability before commitment.
          Saga orchestration with automatic compensation &mdash; if anything fails,
          the system unwinds cleanly. Settlement completes or reverts. No orphaned debits.

        <p class="stakes">
          I've been inside the machine. Technical architect roles in investment banking and treasury,
          where I saw hedge fund accounting run on dozens of tables crammed into a single schema.
          Where eight-figure budgets and multi-year timelines delivered single features.
        </p>
        <p class="proof">
          I've seen what enterprise banking infrastructure looks like when it's done right.
          Real-time. Programmable. Auditable. Beautiful. But it was built for institutions
          with seven-figure budgets. So I'm building the open version.
